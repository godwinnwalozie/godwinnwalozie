Many years of proven experience in the SaaS B2B industry, in fields of operations, data intelligence and revenue strategy ,where I worked closely with mutli diverse - cross functional teams to transform business problems to value.
I've had the good fortune to work closely with technical teams, which fueled my passion for coding, particularly in the fields of data science - and machine learning. I am indeed happy to have grown my skills in these areas, blending both business and technical skills. 😁 
I also love using open source software tools, and appreciate the large community for the value it has created.
